Theme: Running out of power

Entry for the ludum dare 39.

This is my first game jam, and the objective was finish a game on 48 hours or less.

The game was made with Pico-8 the fantasy console [https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php)

Basically the game is a clone of the classic space invaders, with a decreasing power bar. You must control the ship and shoot the aliens to recover a bit of power and make the best score of the universe.

To control the ship use left / right arrows and action or Z key to shoot.
